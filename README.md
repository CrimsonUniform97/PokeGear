PokeGear
===================

Setup
=====
Minecraft: 1.5.2 
MCP: 7.23  
Forge: #716

Get the mentioned Forge and MCP, and decompile (using install.cmd/sh). Once you have a working Forge workspace, pull the repo into that MCP folder.
When more than one contributor is online, we use Saros to collaborate.

COMPILING (to get all that good stuff)
=======================

You need Apache Ant and the JDK. To build, run 'git submodule init' and 'git submodule update' in the root folder.
cd back up one level and simply type 'ant' in the folder with build.xml inside it.
